# GrandChaseMacro

Tired of keep looking at the game 24/7 to watch over and kill any Dimensional boss summoned, I created a macro to assist those who's lazy like me and for people of my guild.

Grand Chase Dimensional Boss Macro - created by GPKeith - Global Sea

1. Enter number of loop
2. Use Party Skill should be yes
3. Party Skill Key, specify the party skill key in Nox, down arrow by default
4. Olivia's Ultimate and Amy's Ultimate skill use, choose yes if you want to use them. Remember to put them in the formation.


REMEMBER TO CHECK NOX KEY BINDING, any problem with the macro, send the log Dbosslog.txt on Desktop to me.
