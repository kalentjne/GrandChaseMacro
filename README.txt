Ver 1.12 Changelog

Optional patch tweak, you don't need to download this patch if you don't need these changes.

I realize that many chaser don't expedition boss / don't have x2 expedition / are unlucky, so the lack of Gardosen is huge. Therefore, an option called "Troll Option" has been added to the Dashboard, which you can specify whether to summon Troll in 5/5 if you don't have Gardosen for that day, or 0/5 if you have 5 Gardosen for the day (leave it as default if you dont want to change anything)

Reduce the number of Auto Sell, now it will sell every 30 boss kills instead of 50 boss kills (many chaser don't expand the inventory, hence the change)
